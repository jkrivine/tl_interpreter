# On orphaned ledgers:
  After 

  ```
    u --K-- v --K'-- w
           Fv
        u --K'-- w
  ```

  The K segment (containing a provisioned ledger) is orphaned. In a
  real-world implementation, ledgers would be flat, that is: not
  contained in a segment but with its own id. Here for simplicity (?) I
  use the fact that the token v was also detached from the tradeline and
  I associate K to v. That way K can be gc'ed and there is a trace of
  that gc operation in the tradeline.

Also, there is no need to return a payoff after `reduce` (i.e. `reduce : ... (tradeline*payoff)` is not necessary and `reduce : ... -> tradeline` is sufficient) since even without an environment, the transferred provisions can stay in the segment's ledger.
